# HandGestureDrone
A real-time gesture-controlled drone system built as an AIMS project. Uses MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and a custom CNN trained on a self-collected dataset for gesture classification. Focuses on safe human–drone interaction, real-time performance, and explainable control logic.
